State_death_rates.pdf
I started with taking the data, which gives a range of mortalities, and converting that to averages by county.  
Then I grouped the county data into states and calculated means for all states.  I plotted this as a bar graph 
which shows that North and South Dakota, Nebraska have the lowest average age-adjusted death rates for this time 
period whereas New Mexico, Arizona, and Kentucky have the highest drug poisoning death rates.
