State_death_rates.pdf
I started with taking the data, which gives a range of mortalities, and converting that to averages by county.  
Then I grouped the county data into states and calculated means for all states.  I plotted this as a bar graph 
which shows that North and South Dakota, Nebraska have the lowest average age-adjusted death rates for this time 
period whereas New Mexico, Arizona, and Kentucky have the highest drug poisoning death rates.

New_Mexico_over_time.pdf
Since I saw that New Mexico had the highest average drug poisoning rate in the country, I wanted to see how that had changed over time.  I took the same averages I already calculated from the range data and instead of averaging all the years together I looked at the averages per year.  This plot shows that the rate of drug poisonings has sharply increased from 1999 to 2015.
